--------------------

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

* Node.js - [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/);
* MongoDb - [Download and install mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) and the npm package manager, if you don't have it yet.

## Structure

The basic structure of this challenge is given in the following way:

* `netshoes-challenge/`Contains the source code of the front-end challenge.
* `data/`Contains sample json file.
* `node_modules/` Contains all dependencies fetched via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/). However, this directory is unnecessary for versioning, so it is ignored.
* `public/` Contains all the static files you use in your application, this is where you store your front-end files.
* `.gitignore` The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
* `LICENSE` A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code.
* `package.json` Lists all [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) dependencies.
* `README.md` Explains how your application works.
